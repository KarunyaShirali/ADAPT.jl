    TETRISADAPT

Score pool operators by their initial gradients if they were to be appended to the pool.
TETRIS-ADAPT is a modified version of ADAPT-VQE in which multiple operators with disjoint 
support are added to the ansatz at each iteration. They are chosen by selecting from 
operators ordered in decreasing magnitude of gradients.
